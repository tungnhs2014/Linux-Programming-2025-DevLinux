# Exercise 2: Thread Synchronization with Mutex

## Description
Write a C program using **pthread** and mutex to perform the following tasks:

## Instructions
1. Create a global variable `counter` initialized to `0`.
2. Create three threads, each of which increments the value of `counter` by `1`, `1,000,000 times`.
3. Use ``mutex` to ensure that the increment operation is performed safely.
4. Print the final value of `counter` after all threads complete.
5. Why is a mutex necessary in this exercise? What would happen if we do not use a mutex?
**ANWSERS:**
- **Why is a mutex necessary in this exercise?**
  + **Race condition:** 
    + When multiple threads access and modify a shared variable (like counter) simultaneously, a race condition can occur.
    + Without a mutex, threads can interleave these steps, leading to data inconsistency.

  + **Synchronization:**
    + A mutex ensure that only **one thread at a time** can perform the increment operation.
    + This prevent other threads from interfering during the update, **ensuring correct and consistent result.**
    
- **What would happen if we do not use a mutex?**
    + **Data Loss:** Threads may simultaneously read the same value of counter, increment it independently, and then write it back. This can cause some increments to be lost.
    + **Incorrect Results:** Instead of the expected value of 3,000,000 (3 threads × 1,000,000 increments), the final counter value may be significantly lower.

## Hint
- Use `pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()` to lock and unlock the mutex when accessing the counter.
