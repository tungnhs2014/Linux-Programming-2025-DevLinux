# Linux File System
## üèÅ 2.1. Introduction to the Linux File System
### 2.1.1. Introduction
Linux follows the philosophy: **"Everything in Linux is a file."** This includes:
‚úÖ Regular files (text files, binary files, executables)
‚úÖ Directories (folders containing other files)
‚úÖ Hardware devices (represented as files)
‚úÖ Storage devices (mounted as file systems)
‚úÖ Sockets and Pipes (inter-process communication)

To display detailed information about files and directories:
```sh
ls -l
```
Example:
```
drwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Mar 09 12:00 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user user 1234 Mar 09 12:34 file.txt
lrwxrwxrwx  1 user user   11 Mar 09 12:40 shortcut -> /home/user/file
crw-rw-rw-  1 root root 1, 3 Mar 09 12:50 /dev/null
brw-rw----  1 root disk 8, 1 Mar 09 13:00 /dev/sda1
```

### 2.1.2. Types of Files in Linux
Linux categorizes files into different types:

| **File Type**         | **Symbol** | **Description** |
|----------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Regular File**     | `-`        | Normal file (text, binary, executables). |
| **Directory**        | `d`        | Folder containing files. |
| **Character Device** | `c`        | Represents character devices (keyboard, mouse). |
| **Block Device**     | `b`        | Represents block devices (hard disks, USB). |
| **Symbolic Link**    | `l`        | Shortcut to another file or directory. |
| **Socket**          | `s`        | Used for inter-process communication. |
| **Pipe**            | `p`        | Creates a pipeline between processes. |

To check the file type:
```sh
ls -l filename
file filename
```

### 2.1.3. Linux File System Structure
The Linux file system is structured as a tree, starting from the root directory `/`.

| **Directory** | **Description** |
|-------------|---------------|
| `/` | Root directory containing all other files and directories. |
| `/bin` | Essential binary executables (ls, cp, mv, cat, grep, ‚Ä¶). |
| `/sbin` | System administration binaries (fsck, reboot, iptables). |
| `/etc` | Configuration files for the system. |
| `/home` | Home directories for users. |
| `/root` | Home directory of the root user. |
| `/dev` | Device files representing hardware components. |
| `/proc` | Virtual filesystem containing system and process info. |
| `/sys` | Information about hardware devices. |
| `/var` | Logs, cache, and mail data. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files (deleted on reboot). |
| `/usr` | Installed applications and system libraries. |
| `/lib` | Shared libraries (*.so files). |
| `/mnt` | Mount points for external storage devices. |
| `/opt` | Optional third-party software. |

To display the directory structure:
```sh
tree /
ls /
```

### 2.1.4. File Permissions & Ownership
Linux enforces strict permissions for security, defined for:
- **Owner (`u`)** ‚Äì The file's owner.
- **Group (`g`)** ‚Äì A group of users with access.
- **Others (`o`)** ‚Äì All other users.

| **Symbol** | **Value** | **Description** |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `r` | 4 | Read permission. |
| `w` | 2 | Write permission. |
| `x` | 1 | Execute permission. |
| `-` | 0 | No permission. |

Example:
```
-rwxr--r-- 1 user user 1234 Mar 09 12:34 file.txt
```
üîπ **Owner** has **rwx** (read, write, execute).
üîπ **Group** has **r--** (read only).
üîπ **Others** have **r--** (read only).

### **üîπ Changing File Permissions (`chmod`)**
```sh
chmod 755 file.txt   # rwxr-xr-x
chmod u+w file.txt   # Add write permission for owner.
chmod g-r file.txt   # Remove read permission from group.
```

### **üîπ Changing File Ownership (`chown`)**
```sh
chown user file.txt   # Change file owner.
chown user:group file.txt   # Change both owner and group.
```

---

### 2.1.5. Disk Management & Partitioning
### **üîπ Check Disk Usage**
```sh
df -h      # Check disk space.
du -sh *   # Check directory size.
```

### **üîπ Creating and Managing Partitions**
```sh
fdisk /dev/sdb  # Manage disk partitions.
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1  # Format a partition.
fsck -y /dev/sdb1  # Check for filesystem errors.
```

### **üîπ Mount and Unmount a Disk**
```sh
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
umount /mnt
```

### 2.1.6. Linux File Systems
| **File System** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **ext4** | Default Linux file system with journaling support. |
| **XFS** | High-performance file system for large systems. |
| **Btrfs** | Supports snapshots and compression. |
| **vfat** | Compatible with Windows. |
| **ntfs** | Windows file system, readable on Linux. |
| **tmpfs** | Temporary filesystem stored in RAM. |

To check the file system type:
```sh
df -T
mount | column -t
```

---

### 2.1.7 Virtual File Systems: `/proc` and `/sys`
üí° **`/proc`** ‚Äì Provides system and process information.
```sh
cat /proc/cpuinfo  # CPU information.
cat /proc/meminfo  # RAM information.
```

üí° **`/sys`** ‚Äì Contains details about hardware devices.
```sh
ls /sys/class/net  # List network interfaces.
cat /sys/block/sda/size  # Check disk size.
```
