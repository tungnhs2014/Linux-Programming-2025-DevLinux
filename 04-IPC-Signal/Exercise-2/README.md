# Exercise 2: Using SIGALRM to Create a Timer

## Description
This project implements a timer using the **SIGALRM** signal. The program sets an alarm to trigger every second and counts the elapsed time up to 10 seconds.

## Requirements
**1. Setting the Alarm:**
- Use the `alarm()` function to trigger **SIGALRM** every second.
**2. Signal Handling:**
- Use the `signal()` function to register the handler for **SIGALRM**.
- Increase the timer count and print the message:
``` bash
Timer: <seconds> seconds
```
**3. Stopping the Program:**
- Stop the timer and exit after counting 10 seconds.

## Hint
- Use the `signal()` function to register the signal handler for **SIGALRM**, and set `alarm(1)` to make the timer repeat every second.

## Question
- Question: What happens if alarm(1) is not called again inside the signal handler?

**ANSWERS:**
- The **SIGALRM** signal will be triggered only once (after the initial call in the main function).
- After handling the first **SIGALRM** signal, the handler will not be called again.
- The program will count up to 1 second and then stop counting (although it will continue running).
- This happens because the alarm() function sets up a one-shot timer, not an automatic repeating timer.
