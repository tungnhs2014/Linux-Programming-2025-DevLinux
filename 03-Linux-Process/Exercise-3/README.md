# Exercise 3: Process Signal

## Description
This project implements a program that creates a **parent-child process** pair. The parent process sends the **SIGUSR1** signal to the child process after a specific delay.

## Requirements
**Signal Handling:**
   - Use the `signal()` function to define the behavior of the child process when receiving the **SIGUSR1** signal.
   - Print a message when the child process receives the signal

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- The `SIGUSR1` signal is used for user-defined purposes and can be caught and handled by the process.
- The `signal()` function is used to define the handler for the signal.
