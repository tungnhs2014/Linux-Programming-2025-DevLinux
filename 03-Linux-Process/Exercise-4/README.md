## Exercise 4: Process Status Recording

## Description
This project implements a program that creates a **child process**, and the parent process uses **wait()** to wait for the child process to terminate and record its exit status.

## Requirements
1. **Child Process Exit Status:**
   - In the child process, set the exit status by calling **exit()** with different values.

2. **Status Recording:**
   - Use **WIFEXITED()** and **WEXITSTATUS()** to check and record the exit code of the child process.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- The **wait()** function is used to wait for the child process to finish.
- The **WIFEXITED()** macro checks if the child process exited normally.
- The **WEXITSTATUS()** macro retrieves the exit status of the child process if it exited normally.
