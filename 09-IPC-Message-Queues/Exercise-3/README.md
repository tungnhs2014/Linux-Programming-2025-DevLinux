# Exercise 3: Communication Between Multiple Processes Using POSIX Message Queues

## Description
Write a program that uses **POSIX message queues** to communicate between **three processes**.

## Requirements
1. Create a **message queue** for communication.
2. The parent process sends a string message into the message queue.
3. **Child process 1** receives the string, **converts it to uppercase**, and sends it back through the **same message queue**.
4. **Child process 2** receives the updated string and prints it to the screen.

## Hint
- Use `mq_send()` and `mq_receive()` for message communication.
- Make sure the processes do not block each other during reading/writing.
- Use `mq_close()` and `mq_unlink()` to close and delete the message queue after completion.
